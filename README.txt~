The basic usage of this code is as follow:
python hdbico_submission.py in_image out_image

If you wish to run the code on the GPU, you can do the following
python hdbico_submission.py in_image out_image [#gpu]

Where #gpu is the device ID of a CUDA enabled GPU, e.g. 0 for single GPU systems.

As this submission consists of trained neural networks, there are two essential
data files that must accompany the python file.  These two files are 'weights.caffemodel'
and 'model.prototxt'.  The executable script  


Dependencies:

The code is in python and relies on the following libraries:
Caffe - For training and using Deep Convolutional Neural networks.  Installation
	instructions can be found here: http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html
	The easiest system for building caffe is Ubuntu 14, as all of the dependencies
	can be installed via the system package manager.
	Installation of CUDA is optional, but recommended.  However, building the python bindings
	is essential.
	Caffe itself has a number of python module dependencies which must also be installed
OpenCV - Again the python bindings are necessary.  I use the python-opencv package
	on Ubuntu 14, though any recent version of open-cv should work as it is used just
	for I/O.
